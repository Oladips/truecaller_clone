# truecaller_clone

This is a project that I started normally as a clone of the truecaller app. This project will have all the intrincate details about the app itself:
* Interacting with the truecaller api for the verified numbers
* Ability to call
* Pop up on device
* On-call and In-call screen

This was the plan but something else caught my eye; A mobile phone concept by Minh Pham
- [Concept 1](https://dribbble.com/shots/16413223-Android-Phone-App-Concept)
- [Concept 2](https://dribbble.com/shots/16388786-Phone-App-Concept-Dialing-Interaction)
- [Concept 3](https://dribbble.com/shots/16434926-Phone-App-Concept-Dialing-Interaction)

This will replace the UI of the whole app but it'll still carry the functionalities of the truecaller app.

Hopefully, this can be a success and be used for daily interactions.
